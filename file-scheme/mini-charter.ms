[draft-ietf-appsawg-file-scheme](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-appsawg-file-scheme)

The "file" URI scheme is woefully out of date. The document that defines
it, RFC 1738, has been superseded by the generic URI syntax of RFC 3986,
and its status is listed as "Obsolete". As such, the "file" URI scheme
is viewed by many in the internet community as being without a current
defining standard, and in need of updating to match current standards
and implementations.

This document defines an updated "file" URI scheme, promoting
interoperability by being compatible with the generic syntax of
RFC 3986, while enumerating commonly-encountered variations that have
arisen during the scheme's long history of vague standardisation.
