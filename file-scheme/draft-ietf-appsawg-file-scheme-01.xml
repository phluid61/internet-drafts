    <abstract>


<t>This document specifies the “file” Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)
scheme, obsoleting the definition in RFC 1738.</t>

<t>It attemps to define a common core which is intended to interoperate
across the broad spectrum of existing implementations, while at the
same time documenting other current practices.</t>

<t><spanx style="strong">Note to Readers (To be removed by the RFC Editor)</spanx></t>

<t>This draft should be discussed on the IETF Applications Area Working
Group discussion list <eref target="mailto:apps-discuss@ietf.org">apps-discuss@ietf.org</eref>.</t>

<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">

<t>A file URI identifies a file on a particular file system.  It can be
used in discussions about the file, and if other conditions are met it
can be dereferenced to directly access the file.</t>

<t>The file URI scheme is not coupled with a specific protocol.  As such,
there is no well-defined set of operations that can be performed on file
URIs, nor a specific media type associated with them.</t>

<t>This document defines a syntax that is compatible with most extant
implementations, while attempting to push towards a stricter subset of
“ideal” constructs.  In many cases it simultaneously acknowledges and
deprecates some less common or outdated constructs.</t>

<section anchor="history" title="History">

<t>The file URI scheme was first defined in <xref target="RFC1630"/>, which, being an
informational RFC, does not specify an Internet standard.  The
definition was standardised in <xref target="RFC1738"/>, and the scheme was
registered with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA);
however that definition omitted certain language included by former
that clarified aspects such as:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>the use of slashes to denote boundaries between directory
levels of a hierarchical file system; and</t>
  <t>the requirement that client software convert the file URI
into a file name in the local file name conventions.</t>
</list></t>

<t>The Internet draft <xref target="I-D.hoffman-file-uri"/> was written in an
effort to keep the file URI scheme on standards track when <xref target="RFC1738"/>
was made obsolete, but that draft expired in 2005.  It enumerated
concerns arising from the various, often conflicting implementations
of the scheme.  It serves as the spiritual predecessor of this document.</t>

<t>Additionally the WHATWG defines a living URL standard <xref target="WHATWG-URL"/>,
which includes algorithms for interpreting file URIs (as URLs).</t>

</section>
<section anchor="similar-technologies" title="Similar Technologies">

<t>The Universal Naming Convention (UNC) <xref target="MS-DTYP"/> defines a string
format that can perform a similar role to the file URI scheme in
describing the location of files.  A UNC filespace selector string has
three parts: host, share, and path; see: <xref target="unc-syntax"/>.  This document
describes a means of translating between UNC filespace selector strings
and file URIs.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="notational-conventions" title="Notational Conventions">

<t>The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”,
“SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this
document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>

<t>Throughout this document the term “local” is used to describe files
that can be accessed directly through the local file system.  It is
important to note that a local file may not be physically located on
the local machine, for example if a networked file system is
transparently mounted into the local file system.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="syntax" title="Syntax">

<t>The file URI syntax is defined here in Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF)
<xref target="RFC5234"/>, including the core ABNF syntax rule <spanx style="verb">ALPHA</spanx> defined by that
specification, and importing the <spanx style="verb">userinfo</spanx>, <spanx style="verb">host</spanx>, <spanx style="verb">authority</spanx> and
<spanx style="verb">path-absolute</spanx> rules from <xref target="RFC3986"/> (as updated by <xref target="RFC6874"/>.)</t>

<t>Please note <xref target="nonstandard-syntax"/> that lists some other commonly seen
but nonstandard variations.</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
   file-URI       = file-scheme ":" file-hier-part

   file-scheme    = "file"

   file-hier-part = "//" auth-path
                  / local-path

   auth-path      = [ file-auth ] path-absolute

   local-path     = path-absolute

   file-auth      = [ userinfo "@" ] host
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>The syntax definition above is different from those given in
<xref target="RFC1630"/> and <xref target="RFC1738"/> as it is derived from the generic syntax
of <xref target="RFC3986"/>, which post-dates all previous specifications.</t>

<t>Systems exhibit different levels of case-sensitivity.  Unless the file
system is known to be case-insensitive, implementations MUST maintain
the case of file and directory names when translating file URIs to and
from the local system’s representation of file paths, and any systems or
devices that transport file URIs MUST NOT alter the case of file URIs
they transport.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="operations" title="Operations on file URIs">

<t>Implementations SHOULD, at a minimum, provide a read-like operation to
return the contents of a file located by a file URI.  Additional
operations MAY be provided, such as writing, creating, and deleting
files.  See the POSIX file and directory operations <xref target="POSIX"/> for
examples of standardized operations that can be performed on files.</t>

<t>File URIs can also be translated to and from local file paths or UNC
strings.</t>

<t>A file URI can only be translated to a local file path if it has a
blank or no authority.  Note that this differs from the previous
specification in <xref target="RFC1738"/>, in that previously an authority of
“localhost” was used to refer to the local file system, but in this
specification it equates to a UNC string with the host “localhost”.</t>

<t>This specification neither defines nor forbids a mechanism for
accessing non-local files.  See SMB <xref target="MS-SMB"/>, NFS <xref target="RFC3530"/>, NCP
<xref target="NOVELL"/> for examples of protocols that can be used to access files
over a network.</t>

<section anchor="file-to-uri" title="Translating Local File Path to file URI">

<t>Below is an algorithmic description of the process used to convert a
file path to an Internationalized Resource Identifier (IRI) 
<xref target="RFC3987"/>, which can then be translated to a URI as per Section 3.1
of <xref target="RFC3987"/>; see: <xref target="encoding"/>.</t>

<t><list style="numbers">
  <t>Resolve the file path to its fully qualified absolute form.</t>
  <t>Initialise the URI with the “file:” scheme identifier.</t>
  <t>If including an empty authority field, append the “//” sigil to
the URI.</t>
  <t>Append a slash character “/” to the URI, to signify the path root.</t>
  <t>For each directory in the path after the root:  <list style="numbers">
      <t>Transform the directory name to a path segment (<xref target="RFC3986"/>,
Section 3.3) as per Section 2 of <xref target="RFC3986"/>.</t>
      <t>Append the transformed segment and a delimiting slash character
“/” to the URI.</t>
    </list></t>
  <t>If the path includes a file name:  <list style="numbers">
      <t>Transform the file name to a path segment as above.</t>
      <t>Append the transformed segment to the URI.</t>
    </list></t>
</list></t>

<t><spanx style="strong">Differences from RFC 1738</spanx></t>

<t>In <xref target="RFC1738"/> a file URL always started with the token “file://”,
followed by an authority and a “/”. That “/” was not considered part
of the path.  This implies that the correct encoding for a file path
in a UNIX-like environment would have been:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
     token     + authority + slash + path
   = "file://" + ""        + "/"   + "/path/to/file.txt"
   = "file:////path/to/file.txt"
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>However that construct was never used in practice, and in fact would
have collided with the eventual encoding of UNC strings in URIs
described in <xref target="ext-unc"/>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="unc-to-uri" title="Translating UNC String to file URI">

<t>A UNC filespace selector string can be directly translated to an
Internationalized Resource Identifier (IRI) <xref target="RFC3987"/>, which can
then be translated to a URI as per Section 3.1 of <xref target="RFC3987"/>; see:
<xref target="encoding"/>.</t>

<t><list style="numbers">
  <t>Initialise the URI with the “file:” scheme identifier.</t>
  <t>Append the authority:  <list style="numbers">
      <t>Append the “//” authority sigil to the URI.</t>
      <t>Append the hostname field of the UNC string to the URI.</t>
    </list></t>
  <t>Append the sharename:  <list style="numbers">
      <t>Transform the sharename to a path segment (<xref target="RFC3986"/>,
Section 3.3) as per Section 2 of <xref target="RFC3986"/>.</t>
      <t>Append a delimiting slash character “/” and the transformed
segment to the URI.</t>
    </list></t>
  <t>For each objectname:  <list style="numbers">
      <t>Transform the objectname to a path segment (<xref target="RFC3986"/>,
Section 3.3) as per Section 2 of <xref target="RFC3986"/>.</t>
      <t>Append a delimiting slash character “/” and the transformed
segment to the URI.</t>
    </list></t>
</list></t>

<t>Example:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
   UNC String:   \\host.example.com\Share\path\to\file.txt
   URI:          file://host.example.com/Share/path/to/file.txt
]]></artwork></figure>

<t><spanx style="strong">Differences from RFC 1738</spanx></t>

<t>In <xref target="RFC1738"/> a file URL an authority of “localhost” was used to
refer to the local file system, but in this specification it
equates to a UNC string with the host “localhost”.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="remote-to-uri" title="Translating Non-local File Path to file URI">

<t>Translating a non-local file path other than a UNC string to a file URI
follows the same basic algorithm as for local files, above, except that
the authority MUST refer to the network-accesible node that hosts the
file.</t>

<t>For example, in a clustered OpenVMS Files-11 system the authority
would contain the node name.  Where the original node reference
includes a username and password in an access control string, they MAY
be transcribed into the userinfo field of the authority (<xref target="RFC3986"/>,
Section 3.2.1), security considerations (<xref target="security"/>) notwithstanding.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="incompat" title="Incompatible File Paths">

<t>Some conventional file path formats are known to be incompatible with
the file URI scheme.</t>

<section anchor="namespaces" title="Win32 Namespaces">

<t>The Microsoft Windows API defines Win32 Namespaces <xref target="Win32-Namespaces"/>
for interacting with files and devices using Windows API functions.
These namespaced paths are prefixed by “\\?\” for Win32 File
Namespaces and “\\.\” for Win32 Device Namespaces.  There is also a
special case for UNC file paths in Win32 File Namespaces, referred to as
“Long UNC”, using the prefix “\\?\UNC\”.</t>

<t>This specification does not define a mechanism for translating
namespaced paths to or from file URIs.</t>

</section>
</section>
</section>
<section anchor="encoding" title="Encoding">

<t>The encoding of a file URI depends on the file system.  If the file
system uses a known non-Unicode character encoding, the path SHOULD be
converted to a sequence of characters from the Universal Character Set
<xref target="ISO10646"/> normalized according to Normalization Form C (NFC) 
<xref target="UTR15"/>, before being translated to a file URI, and conversely a file
URI SHOULD be converted back to the file system’s native encoding when
translating to a file path.</t>

<t><list style='empty'>
  <t>Note that many modern file systems encode directory and file names
as arbitrary sequences of octets.  In those cases, the representation
as an encoded string often depends on the user’s localization
settings, or defaults to UTF-8 <xref target="STD63"/>.</t>
</list></t>

<t>When the file system’s encoding is not known the file URI SHOULD be
transported as an Internationalized Resource Identifier (IRI)
<xref target="RFC3987"/> to avoid ambiguity.  See <xref target="iri-vs-uri"/> for examples.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">

<t>There are many security considerations for URI schemes discussed in
<xref target="RFC3986"/>.</t>

<t>File access and the granting of privileges for specific operations
are complex topics, and the use of file URIs can complicate the
security model in effect for file privileges.  Software using file
URIs MUST NOT grant greater access than would be available for other
file access methods.</t>

<t>File systems typically assign an operational meaning to special
characters, such as the “/”, “\”, “:”, “[”, and “]” characters, and
to special device names like “.”, “..”, “…”, “aux”, “lpt”, etc.
In some cases, merely testing for the existence of such a name will
cause the operating system to pause or invoke unrelated system calls,
leading to significant securt concerns regarding denial of service and
unintended data transfer.  It would be impossible for this
specification to list all such significant characters and device names.
Implementers MUST research the reserved names and characters for the
types of storage device that may be attached to their application and
restrict the use of data obtained from URI components accordingly.</t>

<t>Additionally, as discussed in the HP OpenVMS Systems Documentation
<eref target="http://h71000.www7.hp.com/doc/84final/ba554_90015/ch03s09.html">http://h71000.www7.hp.com/doc/84final/ba554_90015/ch03s09.html</eref>
“access control strings include sufficient information to allow someone
to break in to the remote account, [therefore] they create serious
security exposure.” In a similar vein, the presence of a password in a
“user:password” userinfo field is deprecated by <xref target="RFC3986"/>.  As such,
the userinfo field of a file URI, if present, MUST NOT contain a
password.</t>

<section anchor="iana-considerations" title="IANA Considerations">

<t>IANA maintains the registry of URI Schemes <xref target="BCP115"/> at
<eref target="http://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes/">http://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes/</eref>.</t>

<t>This document defines the following URI scheme, so the “Permanent

<abstract>
<t>
A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a compact sequence of characters
that identifies an abstract or physical resource.  This specification
defines the generic URI syntax and a process for resolving URI references
that might be in relative form, along with guidelines and security
considerations for the use of URIs on the Internet.
The URI syntax defines a grammar that is a superset of all valid URIs,
allowing an implementation to parse the common components of a URI
reference without knowing the scheme-specific requirements of every
possible identifier.  This specification does not define a generative
grammar for URIs; that task is performed by the individual
specifications of each URI scheme.

<t>This document defines a new protocol element, the Internationalized Resource Identifier (IRI), as a complement of the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). An IRI is a sequence of characters from the Universal Character Set (Unicode/ISO 10646). A mapping from IRIs to URIs is defined, which means that IRIs can be used instead of URIs, where appropriate, to identify resources.&lt;/t>&lt;t> The approach of defining a new protocol element was chosen instead of extending or changing the definition of URIs. This was done in order to allow a clear distinction and to avoid incompatibilities with existing software. Guidelines are provided for the use and deployment of IRIs in various protocols, formats, and software components that currently deal with URIs.</t></abstract></front>

<abstract>
<t>Internet technical specifications often need to define a formal syntax.  Over the years, a modified version of Backus-Naur Form (BNF), called Augmented BNF (ABNF), has been popular among many Internet specifications.  The current specification documents ABNF.  It balances compactness and simplicity with reasonable representational power.  The differences between standard BNF and ABNF involve naming rules, repetition, alternatives, order-independence, and value ranges.  This specification also supplies additional rule definitions and encoding for a core lexical analyzer of the type common to several Internet specifications. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t></abstract></front>

<t>The Network File System (NFS) version 4 is a distributed filesystem protocol which owes heritage to NFS protocol version 2, RFC 1094, and version 3, RFC 1813.  Unlike earlier versions, the NFS version 4 protocol supports traditional file access while integrating support for file locking and the mount protocol.  In addition, support for strong security (and its negotiation), compound operations, client caching, and internationalization have been added.  Of course, attention has been applied to making NFS version 4 operate well in an Internet environment.  This document replaces RFC 3010 as the definition of the NFS version 4 protocol.

considerations (<xref target="security"/>) notwithstanding.</t>

<t>This section is not normative.</t>

<section anchor="ext-drives" title="DOS and Windows Drive Letters">

<t>On Windows- or DOS-based file systems a absolute file path can begin
with a drive letter.  To facilitate this, the <spanx style="verb">local-path</spanx> rule in
<xref target="syntax"/> can be replaced with the following:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
   local-path     = [ drive-letter ] path-absolute

   drive-letter   = ALPHA ":"
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>This is intended to support URIs of the form:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t><spanx style="verb">file:c:/path/to/file</spanx>  <list style='empty'>
      <t>The minimal representation of a local file in a DOS- or
   Windows-based environment, with no authority field and an
   absolute path that begins with a drive letter.</t>
    </list></t>
</list></t>

<section anchor="ext-pipe" title="Vertical Bar Character">

<t>Historically some implementations have used a vertical line character
“|” instead of a colon “:” in the drive letter construct.  <xref target="RFC3986"/>
forbids the use of the vertical line, however it may be necessary to
interpret or update old URIs.</t>

<t>For interpreting such URIs, the <spanx style="verb">auth-path</spanx> and <spanx style="verb">local-path</spanx> rules in
<xref target="syntax"/> and the <spanx style="verb">drive-letter</spanx> rule above are replaced with the
following:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
   auth-path      = [ file-auth ] path-absolute
                  / [ file-auth ] file-absolute

   local-path     = [ drive-letter ] path-absolute
                  / file-absolute

   file-absolute  = "/" drive-letter path-absolute

   drive-letter   = ALPHA ":"
                  / ALPHA "|"
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>This is intended to support URIs of the form:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t><spanx style="verb">file:///c|/path/to/file</spanx></t>
  <t><spanx style="verb">file:/c|/path/to/file</spanx></t>
  <t><spanx style="verb">file:c|/path/to/file</spanx>  <list style='empty'>
      <t>Regular DOS or Windows file URIs, with vertical line characters
   in the drive letter construct.</t>
    </list></t>
</list></t>

<t>To update such an old URI, replace the vertical line “|” with a colon “:”.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="ext-unc" title="UNC Paths">

<t>It is common to encounter file URIs that encode entire UNC strings in
the path, with all backslash “\” characters replaced with slashes “/”.</t>

<t>To interpret such URIs, the <spanx style="verb">auth-path</spanx> rule in <xref target="syntax"/> is replaced
with the following:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
   auth-path      = [ file-auth ] path-absolute
                  / unc-authority path-absolute

   unc-authority  = 2*3"/" authority
]]></artwork></figure>

<t><list style='empty'>
  <t><spanx style="strong">Fixme</spanx> <spanx style="verb">authority</spanx> allows ‘[’ and ‘]’ in IPv6 literals, but
RFC3986 forbids them in the path, so the <spanx style="verb">unc-authority</spanx> rule
is not entirely valid.</t>
</list></t>

<t>For example:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
   Traditional:
       file:////hostname/share/object/names
       \_____/\__________________________ /
       Scheme     Transformed UNC string

   Firefox:
       file://///hostname/share/object/names
       \_____/|\__________________________ /
       Scheme |    Transformed UNC string
              Extra slash
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>This extended syntax is intended to support URIs that take the
following forms, in addition to those in <xref target="examples"/>:</t>

<t>Non-local files:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t><spanx style="verb">file:////host.example.com/path/to/file</spanx>  <list style='empty'>
      <t>The “traditional” representation of a non-local file, with an
   empty authority and a complete (transformed) UNC string in the
   path.</t>
    </list></t>
  <t><spanx style="verb">file://///host.example.com/path/to/file</spanx>  <list style='empty'>
      <t>As above, with an extra slash between the empty authority and the
   transformed UNC string, conformant with the definition from
   <xref target="RFC1738"/>; see: exceptions in <xref target="unc-to-uri"/>.  This
   representation is notably used by the Firefox web browser.</t>
    </list></t>
</list></t>

<t>It also further limits the set of file URIs that can be translated to
a local file path to those whose path does not encode a UNC string.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="ext-backslash" title="Backslash as Separator">

<t>Historically some implementations have copied entire file paths into
the path components of file URIs.  Where DOS or Windows file paths were
copied thus, resulting URI strings contained unencoded backslash “\”
characters, which are forbidden by both <xref target="RFC1738"/> and <xref target="RFC3986"/>.</t>

<t>It may be possible to translate or update such an invalid file URI by
replacing all backslashes “\” with slashes “/”, if it can be
determined with reasonable certainty that the backslashes are intended
as path separators.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="iri-vs-uri" title="Example of IRI vs Percent-Encoded URI">

<t>The following examples demonstrate the advantage of encoding file
URIs as IRIs to avoid ambiguity (see <xref target="encoding"/>).</t>

<t>Example: file IRI:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
