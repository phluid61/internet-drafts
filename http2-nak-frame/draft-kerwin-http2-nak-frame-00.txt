1.  Introduction

   Out of the box, the Hypertext Transfer Protocol Version 2 (HTTP/2)
   [RFC7540] makes provision for extension frame types to be sent on a
   connection, with or without prior agreement from either or both
   peers, with the assertion that "implementations MUST discard frames
   that have unknown or unsupported types" ([RFC7540], Section 5.5).
   However it can be useful to explicitly notify the peer if such a
   frame is discarded.

   This document defines an extension to HTTP/2 that allows a peer to
   signal that a received frame was discarded, without altering the
   stream or connection state ([RFC7540], Section 5.1), and in
   particular without triggering an error condition.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Additions to HTTP/2

   This document introduces a new HTTP/2 frame type ([RFC7540],
   Section 11.2).

2.1.  DROPPED_FRAME

   DROPPED_FRAME frames (type code=0xTBA) can be sent on a connection at
   any time to indicate that a received frame was discarded without any
   action being taken.

   The payload of a DROPPED_FRAME frame contains the Type field from the
   discarded frame's header.

                        DROPPED_FRAME Frame Payload

   An endpoint SHOULD send a DROPPED_FRAME frame for an unknown or
   unsupported frame type the first time it discards such a frame.

   An endpoint MAY send a DROPPED_FRAME frame for a particular incoming
   frame type only once, even if it discards multiple frames of that
   type.

   An endpoint that receives a DROPPED_FRAME frame MAY choose to not
   send further frames of that type to this peer, or to take it as an
   indication that the extension is not supported by the peer, or to
   enter into extension negotiations with the peer.

3.  Security Considerations

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document updates the registriy for frame types in the "Hypertext
   Transfer Protocol (HTTP) 2 Parameters" section.

4.1.  HTTP/2 Frame Type Registry Update

   This document updates the "HTTP/2 Frame Type" registry ([RFC7540],
   Section 11.2).  The entries in the following table are registered by
   this document.

                  +---------------+------+-------------+
                  | Frame Type    | Code | Section     |
                  +---------------+------+-------------+
                  | DROPPED_FRAME | TBD  | Section 2.1 |
                  +---------------+------+-------------+
