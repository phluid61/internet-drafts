<t>This document introduces the concept of “segments” to HTTP/2, and adds a
flag to the DATA frame type to allow the expression segments.</t>

<t>A “segment” is a contiguous block of HTTP message data that can be freely
split apart and recombined at any time, allowing transmission in multiple
HTTP/2 frames across network segments with smaller frame size limits
without risk of permanent fragmentation when traversing network segments
with much larger limits.</t>

<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">

<t>This document extends HTTP/2 <xref target="I-D.ietf-httpbis-http2"/> by introducing
the concept of “segments” to HTTP/2, as a mechanism to combat the
effects of fragmentation within a stream. It does this by adding a new
flag to the DATA frame type (<xref target="I-D.ietf-httpbis-http2"/>, Section 6.1).</t>

<section anchor="notational-conventions" title="Notational Conventions">

<t>The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”,
“SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this
document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="segments" title="Segments">

<t>A “segment” is a contiguous region of a HTTP/2 message’s payload data
which can be freely fragmented and recombined. A segment is expressed by
marking all but the final frame in the segment with the
SEGMENT_CONTINUES flag (<xref target="flag"/>). Any data-bearing frame that does
not have the SEGMENT_CONTINUES flag set, and does not follow one that
does, comprises a single segment.</t>

<t>Segments can be used to mitigate the effects of fragmentation within a
stream. For example, an endpoint may have a large chunk of data which it
has to transmit via multiple DATA frames in order to comply with frame
size limits. It can mark those frames as a single segment so that any
downstream peer without the same frame size restrictions knows that it
can safely coalesce the frames.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="setting" title="SETTINGS_USE_SEGMENTS Setting">

<t>The following new SETTINGS parameter (<xref target="I-D.ietf-httpbis-http2"/>,
Section 6.5.2) is defined:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t><spanx style="verb">SETTINGS_USE_SEGMENTS</spanx> (0xTBA):
Informs the remote endpoint of whether or not the sender supports the
SEGMENT_CONTINUES flag (<xref target="flag"/>). A value of 1 indicates that the
sender supports the flag. Any other value MUST be treated as a
connection error (<xref target="I-D.ietf-httpbis-http2"/>, Section 5.4.1) of type
PROTOCOL_ERROR.</t>
</list></t>

</section>
<section anchor="flag" title="SEGMENT and SEGMENT_CONTINUES Flag">

<t>The following new flags are defined for the DATA frame
(<xref target="I-D.ietf-httpbis-http2"/>, Section 6.1):</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t><spanx style="verb">SEGMENT</spanx> (0x10):
Bit 5 being set indicates that the current segment begins and ends
with the current frame.</t>
  <t><spanx style="verb">SEGMENT_CONTINUES</spanx> (0x20):
Bit 6 being set indicates that the current segment continues after
the current frame (see <xref target="segments"/>). If the preceding frame did not
have the SEGMENT_CONTINUES flag, the current segment begins at the
start of the current frame.</t>
</list></t>

<t>Intermediaries MUST NOT coalesce frames across a segment boundary and
MUST preserve segment boundaries when forwarding frames.</t>

<t>The SEGMENT and SEGMENT_CONTINUES flag MUST NOT be set on any frames
unless the remote endpoint has indicated support by sending a
SETTINGS_USE_SEGMENTS setting (<xref target="setting"/>) with a value of 1.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">

<t>In and of itself, segmentation does not introduce any security
concerns. However when used in combination with other features, such
as compression, known and unknown vulnerabilities may be introduced.
See the Use of Compression in HTTP/2 (<xref target="I-D.ietf-httpbis-http2"/>,
Section 10.6).</t>

   In many standards track documents several words are used to signify
   the requirements in the specification.  These words are often
   capitalized.  This document defines these words as they should be
   interpreted in IETF documents.  Authors who follow these guidelines
   should incorporate this phrase near the beginning of their document:

<list>
<t>
      The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
      NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and
      "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
      RFC 2119.
</t></list></t>
<t>
   Note that the force of these words is modified by the requirement
   level of the document in which they are used.

<abstract><t>This specification describes an optimized expression of the semantics of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).  HTTP/2 enables a more efficient use of network resources and a reduced perception of latency by introducing header field compression and allowing multiple concurrent exchanges on the same connection.  It also introduces unsolicited push of representations from servers to clients.  This specification is an alternative to, but does not obsolete, the HTTP/1.1 message syntax.  HTTP's existing semantics remain unchanged.</t></abstract>
